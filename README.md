# 🚀 Electron Playground

## Welcome

Welcome to my Electron Playground! This repository serves as my personal laboratory for exploring and experimenting with Electron.js concepts, features, and best practices. Whether you're a fellow developer looking for examples or just curious about what Electron can do, you'll find a collection of focused mini-applications and proof-of-concepts here.

Each project in this repository demonstrates specific Electron capabilities, from basic desktop app creation to advanced system integrations. Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt any code you find useful!

## Structure

This repository is organized as a collection of self-contained mini-applications, each focusing on a specific Electron concept or feature:

```
electron-playground/
├── basic-app/              # Basic Electron app setup
├── file-operations/        # File system interactions
├── system-integration/     # OS-level integrations
├── ipc-communication/      # Inter-process communication examples
├── native-modules/         # Native module integration
├── security-examples/      # Security best practices
├── performance-demos/      # Performance optimization techniques
└── ui-frameworks/          # Integration with various UI frameworks
```

Each subfolder contains:
- Complete, runnable Electron application
- Dedicated README with specific setup instructions
- Focused examples demonstrating particular concepts
- Comments and documentation explaining key implementation details

## Why this repo?

Electron development involves many moving parts and concepts that can be challenging to master. This playground exists to:

- **Isolate concepts**: Each mini-app focuses on one specific area, making it easier to understand individual features
- **Provide practical examples**: Real, working code that you can run and modify
- **Document learnings**: Capture insights, gotchas, and best practices discovered during development
- **Experiment safely**: Test new ideas and approaches without affecting larger projects
- **Share knowledge**: Offer examples that other developers can learn from and build upon

## Topics Covered

This playground explores a wide range of Electron development topics:

### Core Concepts
